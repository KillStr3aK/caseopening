# caseopening
I'm going to rewrite my whole caseopening system from scratch due to in the private version the cases were hardcoded and it wasn't that easy to modify or add a new case. The sourcecode will be totally open-source and anyone can help or edit. Its not finished yet at all, I'll work on it when I have time.
